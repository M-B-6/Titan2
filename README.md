# Titan2
The Titan 2 programmable controller device acccepts scripts written in C with the .gpc (game proxy code) extension

This repository offers beginner to intermediate educational resources as well as sample code to those looking to learn to write .gpc scripts. This repository assumes that you have learned the basic fundamentals of programming ion C, including things such as, basic logic, if statements, and operators.

Wording and script logic is kept simple and intended to be easy to learn. Comments about the scripts are written in-line for each script (Note that in programming this is generally considered redundant, but is done here to simplify the learning experience)

There may sometimes be multiple scripts to perform the same action (such as the rapid fire scripts). Even though they perform identically, multiple samples are offered as a learning experience.
