# Titan2
The Titan 2 programmable controller device acccepts scripts written in C with the .gpc (game proxy code) extension

This repository offers beginner to intermediate educational resources as well as sample code to those looking to learn to write .gpc scripts

Wording and script logic is kept simple and intended to be easy to learn. Comments about the scripts are written in-line for each script (Note that in programming this is generally considered redundant, but is done here to simplify the learning experience)
